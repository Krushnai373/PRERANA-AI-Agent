PRERANA – Personal Resource for Executive Relief & Academic Nurturing Assistance
PRERANA is a mental-wellness and academic productivity web application designed specifically for students in higher education.
It provides executive-stress relief, habit tracking, mood monitoring, resource tools, and an AI-powered support chatbot — all in one elegant interface.
